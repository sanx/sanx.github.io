<p>It’s happened to me several times that I <code>apt-get install</code> some packages which
prompt me to enter some settings in a <code>curses</code> interface, but I don’t know which
values to enter at the time, or later on realize that I need different settings
than what I had originally entered.</p>

<p>To see the screen that you saw again, just do:</p>

<p><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure PKG_NAME</code></p>

<p>… where <code>PKG_NAME</code> is the name of the package whose configuration screens
you wish to see again.</p>
