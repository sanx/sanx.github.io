            <h1>Blogging with Github Pages and Jekyll</h1>
            <p class="post-date">(14 May 2014)</p>
            <p>I created a repository named <a href="https://github.com/sanx/sanx.github.io"><code>sanx.github.io</code></a> (<em>sanx</em> is my Github username. this blog’s raw data is on that repo!), then I followed the steps to auto publish a page using a layout that I liked from the ones they have available, then I ventured into trying to get it all to work using the Jekyll blogging pattern, basically porting the templates and the includes so that my site is generated using Jekyll while using the templates that I want.</p>

<p>When I was initially trying to get my Markdown posts to be generated by Jekyll on Github Pages, I started getting build error emails, and basically my site wasn’t being updated at all, which prompted me to follow the steps for installing Jekyll locally to make debugging easier. Oh, the surprise when I ran <code>jekyll</code> or even <code>jekyll serve</code> and I got nice outputs, something like the following for <code>jekyll serve</code>:</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Configuration file: none
            Source: /home/germoad/gerardomoad.com
       Destination: /home/germoad/gerardomoad.com/_site
      Generating... 
                    done.
Configuration file: none
    Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
</code></pre>

<p>… which was confusing, because the build was failing on Github Pages, and I was supposedly using the same Jekyll thingie that it does, locally. Upon reading a little more, I followed the following link from the link in my build errors email: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#troubleshooting">https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#troubleshooting</a> , and in there they mention that the most accurate way of running Jekyll in a way that closely resembles how it’s run by Github Pages is by doing <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>. When I ran that command, it gave me a nice debug error pointing to the exact spot on my Markdown document that had a syntax error.</p>
