            <h1>PHP Composer</h1>
            <p class="post-date">(03 Feb 2013)</p>
            <p>PHP Composer dependency manager. I just found out about it. All I have to say is: “Wow!”.</p>

<p>I regularly go back to the <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine Project’s website</a> to review their fabulous ORM’s documentation and to find out if there are any new versions.</p>

<p>Around a week or two ago I went back to Doctrine’s website and something caught my eye: they were no longer recommending downloading the tarballs/zip files, installing with PEAR, or checking out code directly from their source control repo. They were recommending people use what seemed to me like a new, non-standard way to install modules on PHP. I didn’t see the need to upgrade then, so I didn’t bother downloading the new versions either via the traditional methods that I was more familiar with or via this crazy new way.</p>

<p>It was only 2 days ago, while I was doing the usual Friday afternoon web surfing (and after I had just realized the existence of something called PHAR archive packages for PHP, kind of like Java JARs but for PHP) that I went back to Doctrine’s site and I decided to follow the link to the <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/orm">Composer distribution of the Doctrine ORM</a>. I was welcomed by a neat little page that looks everything like what <a href="http://pear.php.net">PHP.net’s PEAR site</a> should look like.</p>

<p>Upon some browsing around the pages for the package that I was interested in, as well as others, I fell in love with <a href="http://www.packagist.org">Packagist</a>, the packaged modules repository that <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> uses by default.</p>

<p>So, basically, what these guys have done is to bring Web 2.0 (shouldn’t that term be way past its expiration date now that we’ve been using it for over 6 years?) toolset cleanness and openness to the PHP world, something that will hopefully help relive a lot of abandoned projects (license permitting, Composer’s compatibility with Git, Mercurial and other DVCMS makes it easy for developers to continue working where somebody else left off, maybe a while ago!).</p>

<p>I expect to make a few more posts on this topic in the near future as I experiment with these new tools.</p>
