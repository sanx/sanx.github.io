                                <p>Trying to get my Jekyll blog setup locally on my new Mac, I&#39;ve been following
these steps, and encountering the following issues:</p>
<p>I remembered that I would need to use <code>bundle</code> to launch my Jekyll instance
in order for it to work the same way as it does on the hosted Github Pages, so I
ran:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> gem install bundle</code></pre>

<p>output:</p>

<p>I also remembered that for everything that the hosted Github Pages does
to work locally, I had to install the <code>git-pages</code> <em>gem</em>. I tried doing so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> gem install github-pages</code></pre>

</code></pre><p>... oopsie, there were at least some native packages that could not be built
on my system. After some investigation, I finally got it working and contributed my solution to <strong>Stack Overflow</strong>
on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/23795873/1369119">here</a>. Damn, it feels good to be a gangster!</p>
<p>Now, I&#39;m able to run <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code> on my Mac locally, and it fires
up an instance of my <strong>Github Pages</strong>/<strong>Jekyll</strong> blog on port 4000.</p>

                                <p>I&#39;ve made my Jekyll blog a little better (closer to having proper blog features)
by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>I fixed the pagination by using the code found at the bottom of the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/">Jekyll
guide page on pagination</a>.</li>
<li>I added RSS support by adapting one of <a href="https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds">the templates I found here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>No. 1 on my <strong>TODO</strong> list is a good commenting model that&#39;s compatible with Jekyll&#39;s
static site generation.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>I created a repository named <a href="https://github.com/sanx/sanx.github.io"><code>sanx.github.io</code></a> (<em>sanx</em> is my Github username. this blog&#39;s raw data is on that repo!), then I followed the steps to auto publish a page using a layout that I liked from the ones they have available, then I ventured into trying to get it all to work using the Jekyll blogging pattern, basically porting the templates and the includes so that my site is generated using Jekyll while using the templates that I want.</p>
<p>When I was initially trying to get my Markdown posts to be generated by Jekyll on Github Pages, I started getting build error emails, and basically my site wasn&#39;t being updated at all, which prompted me to follow the steps for installing Jekyll locally to make debugging easier. Oh, the surprise when I ran <code>jekyll</code> or even <code>jekyll serve</code> and I got nice outputs, something like the following for <code>jekyll serve</code>:</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Configuration file: none
            Source: /home/germoad/gerardomoad.com
       Destination: /home/germoad/gerardomoad.com/_site
      Generating... 
                    done.
Configuration file: none
    Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
</code></pre><p>... which was confusing, because the build was failing on Github Pages, and I was supposedly using the same Jekyll thingie that it does, locally. Upon reading a little more, I followed the following link from the link in my build errors email: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#troubleshooting">https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#troubleshooting</a> , and in there they mention that the most accurate way of running Jekyll in a way that closely resembles how it&#39;s run by Github Pages is by doing <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>. When I ran that command, it gave me a nice debug error pointing to the exact spot on my Markdown document that had a syntax error.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>Now that I&#39;ve <em>kind of</em> lost (I hope that I haven&#39;t, but I&#39;ve been lazy to unbury it from my backups, plus I like being kind of forced to re-do my setup from scratch) my old *nix setup, including my .bashrc and my tmux setup, I need to re-do my tmux setup file.</p>
<p>I like tmux to act gnu screen-ish (mainly having <code>Ctrl-A</code> as the start of command sequences, and having both <code>Ctrl-A Ctrl-A</code> and <code>Ctrl-A A</code> act as <em>jump to last seen panel</em> sequence. I think that&#39;s all I need from gnu screen that&#39;s initially missing in tmux.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: A few days after I initially wrote this post, I realized that about the only settings that I need to change in order to feel comfortable using <code>tmux</code> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the default escape sequence (<code>Ctrl-B</code> by default) to <code>Ctrl-A</code> (a la <em>GNU</em> <code>screen</code>)</li>
<li>use <code>vi</code> keys for navigating the screen (while in copy or command modes)</li>
<li>(bonus) have a nice visual distinction between the currently active window, the last active window, and the rest of the windows on the bottom status bar</li>
</ul>
<p>This was accomplished easily by putting the following <code>.tmux.conf</code> in my home directory:</p>
<pre><code># change the default escape sequence form Ctrl-B to Ctrl-A:
set-option -g prefix C-a
unbind-key C-b
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# use &quot;vi&quot; style screen navigation (as opposed to Emacs, which is what tmux uses by default):
setw -g mode-keys vi
set -g status-keys vi

# make currently active and last active parts of the status bar different from the rest of the windows:
set-option -gw window-status-current-bg &quot;green&quot;
set-option -gw window-status-current-attr &quot;italics&quot;

set-option -gw window-status-last-bg &quot;green&quot;
set-option -gw window-status-last-attr &quot;bold&quot;
</code></pre>

                            <h2><a href="/posts/on-macbook-pros/index.html#main-start">On Macbook Pros</a></h2>
                            <div>
                                <p>Lately, I&#39;ve been observing people on the commuter train, and one particular type of person that I see are people sporting their corporate issued Macbook Pro laptops. Some of them are typing away at their code editors, others are filling in weekly reports, etc.</p>
<p>It&#39;s interesting how about the only people with Macbook Pros that I see look like they&#39;re using the corporate laptop. I don&#39;t see a lot of people who seem to be using their personal privately bought Macbook Pros (although, admittedly, I think I&#39;ve seen a few people with Macbook Airs and other type of older white Macbooks). A few people who I know had Macbook Pros that they had bought by themselves took care of it as if the laptops were more valuable (or needed more care than, at least) a newborn baby. You know the drill: super padded bag case, another zipped case where the laptop is directly put inside, and a cloth covering the keyboard that is perfectly cut to the size of the screen that (I think) it&#39;s meant to protect.</p>
<p><em>Update (May/13)</em>: Yesterday I ordered a maxed out specs 13&#39;&#39; MBPr. After dedicating almost an entire week to look for the &quot;right&quot; laptop, I finally settled on that one.</p>
<p>In the past 1.5 weeks I&#39;ve been using just my 2009 Intel Core 2 Solo (single core) Acer Aspire AS 1410, which, after adding 2 additional GB of RAM ($32 at Fry&#39;s, my favorite store) for a total of 4 GB, <em>and</em> upgrading to the latest Ubuntu 64 bit release, (14.04 LTS ftw!!... it had a 1 year old 32 bit release installed which was dead slow) has turned out to be amazingly fast and responsive considering the hardware limitations. I&#39;m just amazed at how much upping the RAM and using a 64 bit OS and applications helped unlock this baby&#39;s potential.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I didn&#39;t want a MBP is that I felt that I was likely to be using Ubuntu as my primary OS anyway, given how good it has worked for me on this outdated hardware: I wasn&#39;t willing to pay the Apple premiun since I wasn&#39;t planning on using their OSX as my primary OS anyway. Long story short, I found the MBPr 13&#39;&#39; to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just <em>slightly</em> above my ~3 lb of weight limit.</li>
<li>Twice as much RAM as competing PC Ultrabooks that I could get fast (some custom configurations have it but would take an additional 2 to 3 weeks to ship). Considering that neither MBPr nor PC Ultrabooks are user upgradeable.</li>
<li>Twice as much SSD HDD storage capacity compared to PC Ultrabooks that I could get fast (same as the RAM).</li>
<li>1 GHZ faster clock speed on average compared to the Ultrabooks that I was considering (2.8 GHz vs ~1.8 GHz on the Ultrabooks).</li>
<li>Better Intel integrated video (Intel Iris 5000 series video vs Intel 4400 series video on most Ultrabooks, except for the Asus Zenbook which is only $300 chea... less expensive, but comes with half the SSD capacity, half the RAM).</li>
<li>Better by almost 4 hours extra battery life on light usage (with not much video streaming): ~9 hrs vs ~5 hrs for most Ultrabooks.</li>
<li>Easily run OSX, which I was planning to do either using VMs or remote desktop connecting to the Hackintosh desktop that I&#39;m planning to host at home.</li>
<li>Around $800 more expensive than Ultrabooks I was considering.</li>
</ol>
<p>One way I think of it is this: I&#39;m really getting 2 fully featured machines. I&#39;ll likely use OSX with an Ubuntu guest with 8GB of RAM during my day to day, switching back to the OSX host (with a full 8GB available to itself) whenever I would need to use commercial applications like Photoshop, some games, Apple&#39;s Video and Audio editing apps, etc.</p>
