            <p class="post-date">(2014-05-13)</p>
            <div>
                <p>Lately, I&#39;ve been observing people on the commuter train, and one particular type of person that I see are people sporting their corporate issued Macbook Pro laptops. Some of them are typing away at their code editors, others are filling in weekly reports, etc.</p>
<p>It&#39;s interesting how about the only people with Macbook Pros that I see look like they&#39;re using the corporate laptop. I don&#39;t see a lot of people who seem to be using their personal privately bought Macbook Pros (although, admittedly, I think I&#39;ve seen a few people with Macbook Airs and other type of older white Macbooks). A few people who I know had Macbook Pros that they had bought by themselves took care of it as if the laptops were more valuable (or needed more care than, at least) a newborn baby. You know the drill: super padded bag case, another zipped case where the laptop is directly put inside, and a cloth covering the keyboard that is perfectly cut to the size of the screen that (I think) it&#39;s meant to protect.</p>
<p><em>Update (May/13)</em>: Yesterday I ordered a maxed out specs 13&#39;&#39; MBPr. After dedicating almost an entire week to look for the &quot;right&quot; laptop, I finally settled on that one.</p>
<p>In the past 1.5 weeks I&#39;ve been using just my 2009 Intel Core 2 Solo (single core) Acer Aspire AS 1410, which, after adding 2 additional GB of RAM ($32 at Fry&#39;s, my favorite store) for a total of 4 GB, <em>and</em> upgrading to the latest Ubuntu 64 bit release, (14.04 LTS ftw!!... it had a 1 year old 32 bit release installed which was dead slow) has turned out to be amazingly fast and responsive considering the hardware limitations. I&#39;m just amazed at how much upping the RAM and using a 64 bit OS and applications helped unlock this baby&#39;s potential.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I didn&#39;t want a MBP is that I felt that I was likely to be using Ubuntu as my primary OS anyway, given how good it has worked for me on this outdated hardware: I wasn&#39;t willing to pay the Apple premiun since I wasn&#39;t planning on using their OSX as my primary OS anyway. Long story short, I found the MBPr 13&#39;&#39; to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just <em>slightly</em> above my ~3 lb of weight limit.</li>
<li>Twice as much RAM as competing PC Ultrabooks that I could get fast (some custom configurations have it but would take an additional 2 to 3 weeks to ship). Considering that neither MBPr nor PC Ultrabooks are user upgradeable.</li>
<li>Twice as much SSD HDD storage capacity compared to PC Ultrabooks that I could get fast (same as the RAM).</li>
<li>1 GHZ faster clock speed on average compared to the Ultrabooks that I was considering (2.8 GHz vs ~1.8 GHz on the Ultrabooks).</li>
<li>Better Intel integrated video (Intel Iris 5000 series video vs Intel 4400 series video on most Ultrabooks, except for the Asus Zenbook which is only $300 chea... less expensive, but comes with half the SSD capacity, half the RAM).</li>
<li>Better by almost 4 hours extra battery life on light usage (with not much video streaming): ~9 hrs vs ~5 hrs for most Ultrabooks.</li>
<li>Easily run OSX, which I was planning to do either using VMs or remote desktop connecting to the Hackintosh desktop that I&#39;m planning to host at home.</li>
<li>Around $800 more expensive than Ultrabooks I was considering.</li>
</ol>
<p>One way I think of it is this: I&#39;m really getting 2 fully featured machines. I&#39;ll likely use OSX with an Ubuntu guest with 8GB of RAM during my day to day, switching back to the OSX host (with a full 8GB available to itself) whenever I would need to use commercial applications like Photoshop, some games, Apple&#39;s Video and Audio editing apps, etc.</p>
