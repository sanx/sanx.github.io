                <p>PHP Composer dependency manager. I just found out about it. All I have to say is: &quot;Wow!&quot;.</p>
<p>I regularly go back to the <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine Project&#39;s website</a> to review their fabulous ORM&#39;s documentation and to find out if there are any new versions.</p>
<p>Around a week or two ago I went back to Doctrine&#39;s website and something caught my eye: they were no longer recommending downloading the tarballs/zip files, installing with PEAR, or checking out code directly from their source control repo. They were recommending people use what seemed to me like a new, non-standard way to install modules on PHP. I didn&#39;t see the need to upgrade then, so I didn&#39;t bother downloading the new versions either via the traditional methods that I was more familiar with or via this crazy new way.</p>
<p>It was only 2 days ago, while I was doing the usual Friday afternoon web surfing (and after I had just realized the existence of something called PHAR archive packages for PHP, kind of like Java JARs but for PHP) that I went back to Doctrine&#39;s site and I decided to follow the link to the <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/orm">Composer distribution of the Doctrine ORM</a>. I was welcomed by a neat little page that looks everything like what <a href="http://pear.php.net">PHP.net&#39;s PEAR site</a> should look like.</p>
<p>Upon some browsing around the pages for the package that I was interested in, as well as others, I fell in love with <a href="http://www.packagist.org">Packagist</a>, the packaged modules repository that <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> uses by default.</p>
<p>So, basically, what these guys have done is to bring Web 2.0 (shouldn&#39;t that term be way past its expiration date now that we&#39;ve been using it for over 6 years?) toolset cleanness and openness to the PHP world, something that will hopefully help relive a lot of abandoned projects (license permitting, Composer&#39;s compatibility with Git, Mercurial and other DVCMS makes it easy for developers to continue working where somebody else left off, maybe a while ago!).</p>
<p>I expect to make a few more posts on this topic in the near future as I experiment with these new tools.</p>

    <p>This is <a href="https://github.com/sanx">Gerardo Moad</a>'s blog. A blog generated using a <a href="http://metalsmith.io">Metalsmith.io</a> workflow. The blog source lives <a href="https://github.com/sanx/sanx-blog-source">here</a>, and the static files that github serves are <a href="https://github.com/sanx/sanx.github.io">here</a>. I made the site style from scratch using the excellent <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, with <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a>.</p>
